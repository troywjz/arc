# Agent Research Copilot  (ARC)

ARC is a cache-first research toolkit for theoretical-physics papers and
research-domain construction. Use ARC tools instead of scraping arXiv/INSPIRE
or reimplementing paper/domain workflows.

## Preflight Gate

Before any ARC CLI call, decide whether the request is a managed ARC workflow
run or a direct ARC tool task. All requests default to `automation_level: auto`;
never ask the user to choose an execution mode at startup. Use
`interactive` only when the user explicitly asks for manual, step-by-step, or
major-step review or confirmation. A request to discuss before running creates
a pre-run pause rather than a third mode.

Managed workflow runs follow `workflows/domain.md`, `workflows/ideas.md`,
`workflows/check.md`, `workflows/plan.md`, `workflows/calculate.md`, or
`workflows/companion.md`, and
create project-local workflow artifacts such as domain references, ranked
ideas, work notes, note-check records, calculation records, reports, rankings,
recommendations, research directions, or follow-up project directories. For
these, read `rules/interaction.md`. Use the latest explicit user steer as the
current automation level through the end of the managed run or until another
explicit steer changes it. Perform exactly the workflow scope requested
by the caller. Finish at that scope boundary: an automatic domain request does
not authorize idea generation, and automatic idea generation does not
authorize planning or calculation. Required prerequisites named by the owning
workflow may still run, but they do not expand the requested outcome.

Direct ARC tool tasks use the same default-auto and explicit-review policy. These include
bounded paper facts such as title, authors, abstract, citation count, section
text, or equation context, plus user-directed tool orchestration such as
collecting citers or references, filtering papers by date, generating paper
summaries or summary batches, or combining those
steps into a non-evaluative paper-data output. Direct tasks must not produce
recommendations, research directions, scientific rankings, ARC reports, or
project-local workflow artifacts; route those through the owning managed
workflow. Run direct tasks automatically with safe defaults unless the user
explicitly asks to review or confirm steps. Example: `use arc to download
papers that cited 0911.3380 since 2024 and create a full summary of these
papers` is direct ARC tool orchestration, not a managed workflow mode prompt.

ARC LLM calls have no default runtime or inactivity timeout. A caller may set
an explicit positive idle timeout through the owning command when operationally
needed. Use the owning package's status command or the host's
background-command facility for long-running work. Do not stop merely because
the call is long or quiet. An explicit user stop pauses the current attempt for
same-run resume.

## Required References

Read the relevant reference before calling ARC tools. These reads are required,
not optional.

- User choices, automation mode, and confirmation behavior: read
  `rules/interaction.md`. Use its Selection Protocol only for a real business
  choice; mandatory safety or scientific gates may require a direct question.
- Scientific claims, gap scoring, automated workflow decisions, warning
  behavior, or robustness-sensitive execution: read
  `rules/integrity.md`.

  `rules/math_typeset.md`.
- Note checking, verification, or audit requests: read
  `workflows/check.md` before any parse, section read, or equation extraction call.

  (`workflows/check.md`, `workflows/domain.md`, `workflows/ideas.md`,
  `workflows/plan.md`, `workflows/calculate.md`, or `workflows/companion.md`),
  read that workflow file
  and follow its steps. Reading the workflow file is a blocking requirement
  before any workflow CLI call.

  Pandoc/XeLaTeX command in `rules/math_typeset.md`; see
  `manuals/arc-jobs.md` for the workflow failure boundary.

## CLI Resolution

Use `arc-paper`, `arc-render`, `arc-domain`, `arc-llm`, `arc-translate`,
`arc-companion`, and `arc-jobs` directly when the host plugin exposes them on
`PATH`. In DeepSeek Harness, prefer the trusted launcher exported as
`$DSH_ARC_RUNTIME` when it is present; this avoids assuming that a plugin's
package-local `bin/` directory has already been added to the model shell's
`PATH`. The core-only
`arc-proposer-reviewer` tool deliberately has no plugin-bin wrapper; invoke it
through the runtime launcher. For a standalone Skill install, or when a bare
command is unavailable, invoke the same command through:

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/arc-runtime <arc-command> [args...]
```

Within DeepSeek Harness, the equivalent portable form is:

```bash
"$DSH_ARC_RUNTIME" arc-paper <subcommand> [args...]
```

For example:

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/arc-runtime arc-proposer-reviewer trace \
  --run-root <run-root> --run-id <run-id>
```

`inspect`, `trace`, and `show-round` are the only public observation surface
for a proposer-reviewer batch. `inspect` activity is best effort and cannot
drive ranking, recovery, retries, or resume. `trace` exposes only verified
committed-round refs and revision vectors; `show-round` alone expands a
committed proposal/review JSON payload. Never read durable loop or artifact
layout to substitute for these queries.

The first real CLI call lazily installs the immutable core runtime. Managed,
CI, or offline-preparation environments may prewarm it with
`<skill-dir>/scripts/arc-runtime setup --profile core`; diagnose it with
`<skill-dir>/scripts/arc-runtime doctor --profile core`. The base Skill never
installs or starts MCP.

The launcher defaults `ARC_HOME` to `$HOME/.arc`; other hosts may set an
explicit portable location. It keeps reusable runtime installations under
`runtimes/`. The paper cache defaults to `.arc/cache/arc-paper/` below the
launch directory; source-checkout development uses ignored
`local/cache/arc-paper/`. Set `ARC_PAPER_CACHE` for an explicit portable
location. Durable workflow state belongs in each project's hidden `.arc/`
directory. `doctor` reports resolved source, runtime, and paper-cache paths.
Provider selection remains owned by the installed `arc-llm` package.

## Workflow

Follow the workflow step by step. Do not skip any step, and do not kill or
stop any job because it is slow or time consuming.

### Phase 1: Setup

Step 1: Set the automation level and requested scope.
Use this step only for managed ARC workflow runs. For direct ARC tool tasks,
skip the Workflow section and use the relevant manuals and CLI tools
directly.

Default to `auto` without asking. If the user explicitly requests manual,
step-by-step, staged review, or confirmation at key steps, use `interactive`.
Follow runtime steering, one-shot checkpoints, and hard-gate rules in
`rules/interaction.md`. Preserve the caller's requested workflow boundary;
`auto` suppresses routine confirmation questions but never opts the caller
into downstream workflows.

Step 2: Extract `<user-intent>`.
Keep the research/scientific request. Remove operational instructions such as
automation mode, project directory, and output formatting.

Preserve scientific domain anchors in `<user-intent>`, including phrases such
as "in the field started by arXiv:..." or "in the literature around ...".
Those phrases are part of the scientific request, not workflow metadata. Keep
the same paper identifiers separately in `seed_paper_list` as structured
routing data.

If the request references or attaches accessible files such as `.md`, `.pdf`,
`.doc`, or `.jpg`, read or extract the relevant content and summarize it as
part of `<user-intent>`. Treat collaborator notes or images as source context
for routing, domain building, checking, or later workflows.

Step 3: Resolve `<seed-paper-list>`.
Use explicit paper identifiers when present. Otherwise infer seed papers from
`<user-intent>` through ARC paper tools. For a domain request whose relative
date applies to field papers (for example, “field X in the last two years”),
do not treat that date as a seed-paper filter: first resolve a date-unbounded
canonical origin, then use the date window for its citers as specified in
`workflows/domain.md`. Keep the candidate evidence and origin-selection result
separately; only each selected/explicit foundation becomes an entry in
`seed_paper_list` for its domain build. See `manuals/arc-paper.md` for paper
identifier inference and `manuals/arc-jobs.md` for background jobs.

Step 4: Resolve `<project-dir>`.
Capture `<arc-run-root>` by running `pwd -P` in the directory where the user
launched the agent command. Do not use host-internal project/cache locations.
If `<arc-run-root>` is under `.claude`, `.codex`, a plugin directory, or a
cache directory, print `WARNING:` and stop before writing artifacts.

Use a user-specified project directory when present. Otherwise derive
`<project_dir_name>` as a safe directory stem from `<seed-paper-list>` with ARC
paper tools, then resolve `<project-dir>` with:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/resolve-project-dir.py \
  --name <project_dir_name> \
  --run-root <arc-run-root> \
  --json
```

The generated `<project-dir>` must be the direct child
`<arc-run-root>/<project_dir_name>`. Do not create
`arc-output/<project_dir_name>`, do not wrap the safe name in another directory,
and do not write generated workflow artifacts under `.claude`, `.codex`,
plugin dirs, or cache dirs. If the directory already exists, follow the
automation policy in `rules/interaction.md`.

Step 5: Write `<project-dir>/context.json`.
Include `automation_level`, `workflow`, `original_request`, `user_intent`,
`arc_run_root`, `project_dir_name`, `project_dir`, `run_id`, `created_at`,
`skill_version`, `skill_dir`, `skill_workflow_json_dir`, `seed_paper_list`,
`provider`, `model_tier`, `workers`, `refresh`, `recent_window_days`, and
`as_of_date`. A domain origin-resolution path additionally records
`origin_candidates`, `origin_selections`, `origin_selection_run_ids`,
`domain_deduplications`, `foundation_mode`, `citer_selection_mode`, and, when required,
`source_provenance` plus the requested refactor ancestor.

Default `recent_window_days` to `365` and freeze `as_of_date` to the run's UTC
date. When the request says "the last two years", use the exact number of days
between `as_of_date` and the corresponding calendar date two years earlier.

Set `provider` to `auto` unless the user pins a provider. Set `model_tier` to
`medium` unless the user explicitly asks otherwise. Never select the `max`
model tier automatically; use it only when the user explicitly requests the
`max` model tier. See `manuals/arc-llm.md` for model tiers.

Use a stable safe `run_id`: lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores,
for example a short intent slug plus UTC timestamp. Set `skill_dir` to the ARC
skill directory and `skill_workflow_json_dir` to
`<skill-dir>/workflows/json`.

When resuming a managed run, reconcile `automation_level` with the latest
explicit user steer and update the existing `context.json` in place. Do the
same after a runtime switch. Direct tool tasks do not create a state file solely
for this field; follow the latest explicit instruction in the current session.

### Phase 2: Route Selection

Resolve the user's intent and classify it into one of the five cases below.
Choose only the case needed for the requested outcome. Run another case only
when it is an explicit prerequisite below or the caller also requested that
outcome. Never interpret `auto` as permission to advance to a later case.

Case 1: Build domain references only.
Read and execute `workflows/domain.md`.

Case 2: Suggest ideas from a not-yet-explicit request.
First complete Case 1. Then read and execute
`workflows/ideas.md`. The workflow owns one public `BatchRequest` in its
project-local `RunRepository`; inspect and rank only its verified committed
rounds. Do not substitute private loop files, worker sessions, retired
intermediary artifacts, nested ARC CLIs, or MCP calls for that contract.

Case 3: Check note files or collaborator notes.
Use when the request asks to check, verify, audit, or mark work-note premises
and claims in one or more accessible `.md` or `.pdf` notes.
`workflows/check.md` was already loaded in Required References.
Follow its 5-phase workflow: Parse -> Preflight -> Write Planning Handoff ->
Execute `plan.md` and `calculate.md` -> Record Note-Check Status.
Do not skip directly to parsing results; the preflight, planning handoff, and
owned-workflow execution steps are mandatory.

Before leaving Case 3 or sending a final response, read
`<project-dir>/.arc/calculate/<run-id>/work-note.md`. If any ready detailed step exists, execute
`workflows/calculate.md`. If no ready detailed step exists but rough or pending
coverage remains from the original note-check request, return to
`workflows/plan.md`. Adjudicate every item in `Rough Steps For Later Planning`:
promote and execute it, remove or mark it obsolete/not triggered, or record an
explicit stop condition in `Open Questions` or `Calculation Status`. Only stop
when requested coverage is complete and no triggered rough/pending item remains.

Case 4: Calculate from an explicit idea.
If the idea is not explicit enough, first complete Case 1 and Case 2, then ask
the user to select one concrete idea only in `interactive` mode. In `auto`
mode, use ranked idea #1 without asking.
If the idea is explicit enough:
Step 1: Read and execute `workflows/plan.md`. It writes or updates the hidden
current work note under `<project-dir>/.arc/calculate/<run-id>/` and publishes
the visible `<project-dir>/work-note.pdf`.
Step 2: Read and execute `workflows/calculate.md`. If `calculate.md` requests
macro expansion or blocked-step refinement, return to Step 1 for that region.

Before leaving Case 4 or sending a final response, read
`<project-dir>/.arc/calculate/<run-id>/work-note.md`. If any ready detailed step exists, execute
`workflows/calculate.md`. If no ready detailed step exists but rough or pending
coverage remains from the original calculation request, return to
`workflows/plan.md` to promote the next coherent chunk. Adjudicate every item
in `Rough Steps For Later Planning`: promote and execute it, remove or mark it
obsolete/not triggered, or record an explicit stop condition in `Open Questions`
or `Calculation Status`. Only stop when requested calculation coverage is
complete and no triggered rough/pending item remains.

Case 5: Generate a Companion reader.
Use only when the user explicitly requests a companion reading or asks for the
original paper to be split into semantic units with interleaved translation
and commentary.
Read and execute `workflows/companion.md`. The default deliverable is a
standalone HTML reader. If a PDF copy is requested, the user may open the HTML
in Chrome and use Print / Save as PDF. That user-side derivative is not an ARC
release artifact.

### Phase 3: Self-Reflection

Read and follow `rules/self-reflection.md`.
